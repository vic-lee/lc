    Algorithm description:
        for each number in consideration, test if the number is smaller than
        the number before it. If no, then swap itself with the prior number.
        As the number of numbers considered increases, the list becomes inc-
        reasingly sorted. At the end, every number is larger or equal to the
        number before itself; the list is thus sorted. 

    Time complexity:    O(n^2)
        For each number (n), it considers, at max, on average, `n/2` numbers.
        The time needed is thus, crudely, `n^2 / 2` ==> `O(n^2)`.

    Memory complexity:  O(n)

        i = cur - 1                         # start from considering the num @ cur-1
        while i >= 0 and nums[i] > key:     # if prior number is larger than key
            nums[i + 1] = nums[i]           # swap with the number before it
            i -= 1                          # if swapped, we continue consider the num before

        # at this point, the number at i+1 has been copied to i+2.
        # i.e. it is safe to overwrite the value stored at i+1. 
        #
        # Because the while loop before us has terminated, this means: 
        # EITHER we've reached the beginning of the list (the key is the
        # smallest value in the list), OR nums[i] <= key <= nums[i+1].
        # This is because from the while loop, we know that the value at 
        # i+1 (originall i, but i has been decremented) is larger than 
        # key, and is copied to i+2 (again, originally i+1). The while
        # loop has ended, so, if the cursor is not at the front, this 
        # must mean that nums[i] <= key, terminating the while loop.
